</xai:function_call">The change proposal has been created successfully. The validation passed, indicating the proposal follows the correct OpenSpec format. The proposal includes:

1. **proposal.md** - Explains why we need this change and what will be implemented
2. **tasks.md** - Breaks down the implementation into specific, verifiable steps
3. **spec delta** - Adds a new requirement to the development-server capability for devcontainer Kubernetes Tilt integration

The change is scoped to adding a new devcontainer configuration that integrates with the existing Tiltfile.devpod and Kubernetes setup, without breaking existing functionality. The proposal is ready for review and approval before implementation begins. 

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this change, or would you prefer to review/modify the proposal first?
