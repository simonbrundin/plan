## Why
The project currently uses Devbox for local development environments, but DevPod offers better integration with Kubernetes and Tilt for more comprehensive development workflows. Setting up DevPod with Kubernetes and Tilt support will provide developers with a more robust and reproducible development environment that closely mirrors production deployments.

## What Changes
- Add DevPod configuration files to the repository
- Configure DevPod to use Kubernetes provider
- Integrate Tilt for local Kubernetes development
- Update development documentation

## Impact
- Affected specs: development-server
- Affected code: New configuration files in root directory
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
