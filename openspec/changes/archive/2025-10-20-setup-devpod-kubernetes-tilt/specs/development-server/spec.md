## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: DevPod Environment Setup
The repository MUST include DevPod configuration that enables developers to create reproducible development environments using Kubernetes and Tilt. DevPod workspaces MUST be configurable to use the local Kubernetes cluster with Tilt for development server management.

#### Scenario: DevPod workspace creation
- **WHEN** a developer runs `devpod up` in the repository
- **THEN** a DevPod workspace is created successfully
- **AND** the workspace uses Kubernetes as the provider
- **AND** Tilt is integrated for local development

#### Scenario: Kubernetes and Tilt integration
- **WHEN** the DevPod workspace starts
- **THEN** Kubernetes cluster is accessible
- **AND** Tilt can manage development services
- **AND** the development server runs within the Kubernetes environment

#### Scenario: Development workflow compatibility
- **WHEN** using DevPod with Kubernetes and Tilt
- **THEN** existing development commands work (bun run dev, bun run build)
- **AND** database connections are properly configured
- **AND** hot reloading functions correctly
