## Why
The development server is throwing a 500 error with "obj.hasOwnProperty is not a function" during Pinia store hydration. This occurs because the custom hydration logic in the goals store is incorrectly setting object prototypes, causing serialization issues during SSR.

## What Changes
- Fix the Pinia store hydration logic to properly handle object serialization/deserialization
- Remove the problematic `Object.setPrototypeOf()` calls that are causing the hasOwnProperty error
- Ensure store state can be properly hydrated without prototype issues

## Impact
- Affected specs: development-server
- Affected code: goals store hydration logic
- No breaking changes to existing functionality</content>
</xai:function_call">Now I'll create the tasks.md file. The tasks should be:
1. Analyze the current hydration logic
2. Fix the hydration approach
3. Test the dev server
4. Validate that the error is resolved

Let me create the tasks file. Then I'll create the spec delta. The spec should modify the existing development-server requirement to include proper hydration. Let me check what the current spec looks like first.
