## Why
The development server is currently returning HTTP 500 errors, preventing proper development workflow and blocking progress on the application.

- Diagnose and fix the root cause of HTTP 500 errors in the dev server
- Ensure the development server starts successfully and serves the application without errors

## Impact
- Affected specs: development-server
- Affected code: Frontend Nuxt.js configuration and setup files
- No breaking changes to existing functionality</content>
